The **Simplest** Faster way to open your REPL for filetypes.

## VS reply.vim

reply.vim is another good way to open REPL.
But this focuses to synchronize REPL buffers and file buffers,
this often requires a configuration for unknown REPLs
(e.g. `stack ghci`).

vim-quickrepl focuses **simplicity** to configurate.
